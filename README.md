# Tidy-Elements

I'm a former Googler who first heard about Polymer before it had the name, I  didn't use it as part of my work but have since started using it more and more in my personal projects. This project contains a selection of elements that I've created to speed up my own web development and I thought some of them might be usful for others.

*Polymer Elements for quickly building basic sites and prototypes, including wrappers for very basic elements*
